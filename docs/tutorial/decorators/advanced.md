Advanced Security Decorators
============================

Advanced security decorators offer sophisticated controls for fine-tuning your application's security posture. These decorators allow you to implement time-based access rules, set up honeypots to trap malicious bots, and control suspicious pattern detection on a per-route basis.

___

Time-Based Access Control
-------------------------

Restrict access to endpoints based on specific time windows. This is useful for APIs that should only be available during business hours or maintenance periods.

. Restrict to Business Hours
--------------------------

```python
from guard.decorators import SecurityDecorator

guard_deco = SecurityDecorator(config)

@app.get("/api/reports")
@guard_deco.time_window("09:00", "17:00", "EST")
def generate_reports():
    return {"message": "Reports are only available during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM EST)"}
```

. Maintenance Window
------------------

Only allow access during a specific maintenance window.

```python
@app.post("/api/maintenance")
@guard_deco.time_window("01:00", "03:00", "UTC")
def perform_maintenance():
    return {"status": "Maintenance operations running"}
```

___

Honeypot Protection
-------------------

Set up "honeypot" fields in your forms or JSON payloads to detect and block bots. These fields are hidden from human users but are often filled out by automated scripts.

. Basic Honeypot
--------------

Add a honeypot field to a registration form. If a bot fills it, access is denied.

```python
@app.post("/register")
@guard_deco.honeypot_detection(trap_fields=["website_url"])
def register_user(form_data: dict):
    # This field should be hidden via CSS for real users
    return {"message": "User registered successfully"}
```

*In your frontend, you would hide the `website_url` field, for example, with `style="display:none"`.*

. Multiple Honeypot Fields
------------------------

Use multiple fields to increase the chances of trapping a bot.

```python
@app.post("/contact")
@guard_deco.honeypot_detection(trap_fields=["comments", "phone_number_alt"])
def contact_form(form_data: dict):
    return {"status": "Message sent"}
```

. JSON Payload Honeypot
-----------------------

Honeypots also work with JSON request bodies.

```python
@app.post("/api/subscribe")
@guard_deco.honeypot_detection(trap_fields=["user_nickname"])
def subscribe_newsletter(payload: dict):
    return {"message": "Subscribed successfully"}
```

___

Suspicious Pattern Detection Control
------------------------------------

Globally, FastAPI Guard may be configured to detect suspicious patterns in requests. This decorator allows you to override that setting for specific endpoints where the global rules may not be appropriate.

. Disable Detection for a Specific Route
--------------------------------------

If an endpoint accepts data that might trigger false positives (e.g., code snippets, complex user-generated content), you can disable suspicious pattern detection for it.

```python
@app.post("/api/code-submission")
@guard_deco.suspicious_detection(enabled=False)
def submit_code(code: str):
    # This endpoint is safe from pattern detection false positives
    return {"status": "Code submitted for review"}
```

. Explicitly Enable Detection
---------------------------

While detection is often enabled by default, you can use this decorator to make it explicit, improving code readability.

```python
@app.get("/api/search")
@guard_deco.suspicious_detection(enabled=True)
def search(query: str):
    return {"results": "Search results for your query"}
```

___

Combining Advanced Decorators
-----------------------------

You can stack advanced decorators with each other and with other security decorators for robust, layered security.

. High-Security Endpoint
----------------------

This endpoint is only accessible during specific hours and is protected by a honeypot.

```python
@app.post("/api/admin/config")
@guard_deco.time_window("10:00", "16:00", "UTC")
@guard_deco.honeypot_detection(trap_fields=["admin_email_confirm"])
@guard_deco.require_auth(type="bearer") # From authentication decorators
def update_admin_config(config_data: dict):
    return {"status": "Configuration updated"}
```

___

Error Handling
--------------

Advanced decorators integrate with the middleware's error handling:

- **403 Forbidden**:
  - When a request is outside the allowed `time_window`.
  - When a `honeypot_detection` field is filled.

. Custom Error Messages
---------------------

You can configure custom error messages in the `SecurityConfig`.

```python
config = SecurityConfig(
    custom_error_responses={
        403: "Access denied. Please check access times and ensure you are not a bot."
    }
)
```

___

Best Practices
--------------

. Use Timezones Explicitly
------------------------

Always specify the timezone in `time_window` to avoid ambiguity, especially for applications serving a global user base.

```python
# Good: Explicit timezone
@guard_deco.time_window("09:00", "17:00", "America/New_York")

# Avoid: Relying on default UTC if your users are in different timezones
# @guard_deco.time_window("09:00", "17:00")
```

. Hide Honeypot Fields Effectively
--------------------------------

Ensure honeypot fields are truly hidden from human users using CSS or other frontend techniques. A visible honeypot field can confuse users and defeat its purpose.

. Be Strategic with Detection Control
-------------------------------------

Only disable `suspicious_detection` when necessary. Disabling it globally or on many endpoints can weaken your application's defenses against penetration attempts.

Now that you've learned about advanced decorators, you can explore other decorators to build a comprehensive security strategy:

- **[Behavioral Analysis Decorators](behavioral.md)** - Monitor usage patterns and detect anomalies.
- **[Content Filtering](content-filtering.md)** - Validate and sanitize request data.
- **[Rate Limiting Decorators](rate-limiting.md)** - Protect against brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.
