   - Click on "New draft security advisory"
   - Fill in the details of the vulnerability
   - Submit the advisory

   Alternatively, you can report vulnerabilities through [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature](https://github.com/rennf93/fastapi-guard/security/advisories/new).

3. Include the following information in your report:
   - A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
   - Steps to reproduce the issue

## Security Best Practices

When using FastAPI Guard in your applications, consider the following security best practices:

### Configuration Recommendations

1. **API Tokens**: Store your IPInfo token securely using environment variables or a secure secrets management system, not hardcoded in your application.

2. **Whitelist and Blacklist**: Regularly review and update your IP whitelists and blacklists.

3. **Rate Limiting**: Set appropriate rate limits based on your application's requirements to prevent abuse.

4. **Auto-Ban Settings**: Configure auto-ban thresholds and durations based on your threat model.

5. **Country Blocking**: Only block countries if necessary for compliance or security reasons.

6. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Always enable HTTPS enforcement in production environments.

7. **CORS Settings**: Configure CORS settings with the principle of least privilege, only allowing necessary origins, methods, and headers.

### Redis Security

If using Redis for distributed state management:

1. Enable Redis authentication with a strong password
2. Configure Redis to only listen on localhost or use a secure network
3. Use TLS/SSL for Redis connections in production
4. Regularly update your Redis instance to the latest stable version

### Logging and Monitoring

1. **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation for security logs to prevent disk space issues
2. **Log Monitoring**: Regularly review security logs for suspicious activity
3. **Alerts**: Set up alerts for unusual patterns detected by FastAPI Guard

### Dependency Management

1. Regularly update FastAPI Guard and its dependencies to the latest versions
2. Use a dependency scanning tool to identify and address vulnerabilities in your dependency tree
